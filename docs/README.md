Pew Research Foundation, 2020 Survey on Work

The Pew Research Center conducted a survey Oct. 13-19, 2020 to better understand the experiences of employed parents during the coronavirus. Everyone who took part is a member of the Centerâ€™s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. This analysis is based on extracts from the survey.
